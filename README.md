# Spam-Detection-with-Transfomers
I attempted to solve the spam detection problem and conducted various experiments to derive insights
Insights:
  1. Fine tuning on **paraphrased spam may hurt performance** because the paraphrased emails may have their meaning altered detrimentally
  2. **Concatenating predictive features as string to the "text" improves further improves performance of BERT!**
